## Parts of this repository

* [Extractive Oracle](./Extractive%20Oracle): Contains the extractive Oracles we made for each event with ROUGE-2 and Cosine similarities.

For more annotations including tweets ids, please contact us. We can't release this amount of tweets ids on this Git due to the distibution restrictions imposed by Twitter.
